        <p>Red Sox Data Bot is a Red Sox version of <a href="https://dodgersdata.bot/">Dodgers Data Bot</a>, built by <a href="https://mattstiles.me/">Matt Stiles</a>. His site is an auto-updating dashboard that tracks how the Los Angeles Dodgers are doing — today and in the context of franchise history - this one does the same thing, but for the Boston Red Sox instead.</p>

        <p>Every day during the season, the bot pulls fresh stats from <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/">Baseball Savant</a> and <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/">Baseball Reference</a> — standings, batting averages, and more — then turns them into clean, readable charts and tables that capture the story of the season.</p>

        <p>The goal? Make baseball data approachable. Show how the team is performing now, how it stacks up against more than a century of Red Sox history, and what might be coming next.</p>

        <h2 class="about-subhead">Why it exists</h2>

        <p>As mentioned above, Matt Stiles created the original dashboard and was kind enough to release <a href="https://github.com/stiles/dodgers">the code</a> under an open source license. As someone who likes the Red Sox like he likes the Dodgers, I've wanted an equivalent for a while. In my day job as an analyst, then, my standard project for evaluating new code assist tools was the Dodgers Data Bot. They all had pluses and minuses, but it was ultimately Claude Code that got me over the hump and brought the Red Sox Data Bot to life.</p>  
        
        <h2 class="about-subhead">Thanks</h2>

        <p>Many thanks to Matt for coming up with the original idea for Dodgers Data Bot, and for going even further and sharing his hard work so that I could adapt it to bring this site to life. I'd be remiss to not thank Claude Code and its designers, meanwhile, because I would not have had the time to make this happen without its assistance.</p>

        <h2 class="about-subhead">Join the conversation</h2>

        <p>I'd love to hear how you're using this. <a href="https://github.com/sogrady/redsox-bot">Check out the code on GitHub</a> or drop a suggestion.</p>

        <p>Go Sox!</p>
