        <p>Red Sox Data Bot is an auto-updating dashboard that tracks how the Boston Red Sox are doing — today and in the context of franchise history dating back to 1901.</p>

        <p>Every day during the season, the bot pulls fresh stats from <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/">Baseball Savant</a> and <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/">Baseball Reference</a> — standings, batting averages, and more — then turns them into clean, readable charts and tables that capture the story of the season.</p>

        <p>The goal? Make baseball data approachable. Show how the team is performing now, how it stacks up against more than a century of Red Sox history, and what might be coming next.</p>

        <h2 class="about-subhead">Why it exists</h2>

        <p>I'm a Red Sox fan who loves bringing data to life. I built this because following the team is even more rewarding when you can see the season unfold through clean visualizations and historical context. A little insight makes every win more fun and every cold streak (slightly) easier to understand.</p>

        <h2 class="about-subhead">Join the conversation</h2>

        <p>I'd love to hear how you're using this. <a href="https://github.com/sogrady/redsox-bot">Check out the code on GitHub</a> or drop a suggestion.</p>

        <p>Go Sox!</p>
